#the board is a 9X9 grid of tuples ([int], int).
#   -The first element is the wall state array, the second number is the player number
#   WALL STATE ARRAY:
#       -The array is of size 4, with each element representng an adjacent wall, starting with the north wall at position 0 and going clockwise.
#           -[N,E,S,W]
#       -0 represents no wall
#       -1 represents that there is a wall.
#           - if a player is in a square they cannot move to another square if there is a wall in that direction.
#           - edge squares will always show the outside edge as having a wall.
#           - EX: the grid position (0,0) will have the wall state [1,0,0,1] at the start of the game.
#   PLAYER NUMBER:
#       - identifies a player.
#       - 0 is reserved for an empty square, any other integer may represent a player although it uses 1 and 2 for simplicity
# 
#   EXAMPLE BOARDSTATE WITH 3X3 GRID AT THE START OF A GAME
#   [([1,0,0,1],0), ([1,0,0,0],1), ([1,1,0,0],0)
#    ([0,0,0,1],0), ([0,0,0,0],0), ([0,1,0,0],0)
#    ([0,0,1,1],0), ([0,0,1,0],2), ([0,1,1,0],0)]
#    - no walls have been placed, the only walls are the outside edges.
#   
#   EXAMPLE BOARDSTATE AFTER A WALL HAS BEEN PLACED BETWEEN THE FOR SQUARES (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)
#   [([1,0,1,1],0), ([1,0,1,0],1), ([1,1,0,0],0)
#    ([1,0,0,1],0), ([1,0,0,0],0), ([0,1,0,0],0)
#    ([0,0,1,1],0), ([0,0,1,0],2), ([0,1,1,0],0)]
#
#       You can think of the wall array as a list of possible move for a player on that square, 
#       so in the above example player 1 cannot move north or south as there is a wall in that direction

# the parameter input is used to initialize a boardstate with an already established one.
# if input is empty, a default boardstate of size 9 will be used.
# if you wish to change the board size, initialize the BoardState as BoardState(size=x) where x is the custom size
#   - x can be any positive odd integer. if x does not meet those criteria it will default to 9 (the size needs to be odd so that the players will start in the middle square on their respective sides)
# playerCount is the number of players on the board, this defaults to 2
